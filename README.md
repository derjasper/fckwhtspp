# FCKWHTSPP

Since all Facebook-related services block all links to telegram.me (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/telegram/status/705125343011725312)), we need an alternative. (Original repository: https://github.com/derjasper/fckwhtspp)

This script redirects all requests to telegram.me and is deployed using GitHub pages. Simply replace telegram.me/yourname with https://derjasper.github.io/fckwhtspp/#yourname and you can post this link on Facebook or whatever service you use.

## Deploy this script yourself
